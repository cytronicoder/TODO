I want to make a clock like the one shown in the Instagram reel and give it to one of my friends for fun:

- [ ] Round base for the clock face (laser cut wood?)
- [ ] Clock mechanism (ask Design department for spares/buy online)
- [ ] 3D printer/acrylic cutter to create numbers and math symbols
- [ ] Paint or markers
