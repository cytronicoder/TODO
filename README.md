# README

This is a dedicated space for me to organise potential projects or enhancements that I might consider working on in the future. It's a place to document inspirations, fleeting thoughts, and detailed proposals, ensuring that they are not lost and can be revisited when the time is right.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! Whether it's adding new ideas, refining existing ones, or providing feedback on feasibility, everyone's encouraged to contribute.

## How it works

To add a new TODO:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Open the `TODO.md` file.
3. Add your idea using a bullet point.
4. Provide a brief description or note that explains the idea or task in the `deets` folder, with an appropriate text file name. For example, if you want me to build a calendar app, you might name the file `calendar.md`.
5. Optionally, add any emojis to the TODO! ðŸš€

Periodically, I will review the TODO list to decide which ideas to prioritize or discard.
